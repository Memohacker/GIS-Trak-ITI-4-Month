	Description:
		Abstract:
			The Hamilton County 2009 digital natural-color orthophotography
			was collected on March 30 during leaf-off conditions at a
			resolution of 6-inch resolution. The data cover the entire land 
                        area of Hamilton County, Indiana, or 434 square miles. Data
			are delivered tiles, consisting of 2500'x 2500'
			uncompressed 24-bit natural color TIFF files.  Accuracy is
			+/- 2.50 feet. The entire perimeter of the county is buffered 
                        by at least 2,000 feet. Adjacent flight lines overlap by a 
                        minimum of 30 percent.  Imagery was collected with the 
                        Z/I Imaging DMC digital sensor.  The file naming 
                        convention is as follows: xxxyyyy where xxx and yyyy represent 
                        the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state 
                        plane feet, divided by 1000, of the tile origin (the bottom-left 
                        pixel).  TIFF files are approximately 75 MB in size.  Ownership 
                        of the data products resides with Hamilton County.
		Purpose:
			Hamilton County acquires orthophotography frequently because
                        of its high growth rate.

	Data_Set_Credit:
		This data set was acquired for the Hamilton County by
		Sanborn; quality assurance was provided by The Sidwell Company.
Data_Quality_Information:
	Attribute_Accuracy:
		Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
			The digital orthophotos were evaluated by The Sidwell Company
			to ensure each tile extent was 2500 feet x 2500 feet in 
			Eastings and Northings for the appropriate Indiana State Plane 
			coordinate system, that the world file references the 
			center of the pixel located in the upper left hand corner
			of the tile as the point of origin, that the ground sample
			distance (GSD) is 6-inches.			
	Logical_Consistency_Report:
		Compliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by comparison
                with previously acquired orthophotography and planimetric data.
	Completeness_Report:
		The following methods are used to assure imagery
		accuracy.
		1. Use of IMU and ground control network utilizing GPS
		techniques.
		2. Use of airborne GPS in conjunction with the acquisition
		of imagery.
